    "\n",
    "There are columns of integers representing nodes. Each row corresponds to a node and contains its x and y coordinates in a plane, as well as a cost associated with the node. There were 4 such data sets each consisting of 200 rows (each representing a single node).\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem to solve is to choose precisely 50% of the nodes (rounding up if there is an odd number of nodes) and create a Hamiltonian cycle (a closed path) using this subset of nodes. The goal is to minimize the combined total length of the path and the total cost of the selected nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the distances between nodes, the Euclidean distance formula was used and then round the results to the nearest integer. As suggested, the distances between the nodes were calculated after loading the data and placed in a matrix, so that during the subsequent evaluation of the problem, it was only necessary to read these values which reduced the cost of the operation of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem the local search algorithm (steepest) with candidate moves was used. We operate in edge-intra and inter neighbourhood."

    "Analyzing the results and visualizations, one can come to several conclusions about the algorithms used in the task:\n",
    "- **Time of running local search algorithm (steepest) with candidate is greatly reduced** in comparison with its version without candidates. This is due to the fact that the number of iterations of the algorithm is reduced, because the algorithm does not have to check all possible neighbours, but only a few of them.\n",
    "- The running time for steepest local search with *N* candidates grows linearly with *N*. This is due to the fact that the algorithm has to check all *N* candidates, and makes *N* * *|S|* * 2 comparisons per interation, where *|S|* - solution size (constant), so the total time is linearly proportional to *N* (even though the number of iterations may vary).\n",
    "- The mean cost of the solution found by the algorithm with candidates decreases as the number of candidates *N* increases in a non-linear way - initial decrease is very steep, and then it slows down. Any number of candidates greated than 15 does not seem to have a significant impact on the minimum cost of the solution found by the algorithm, whilst the time of running the algorithm increases significantly.\n",
    "- Experiments with the number of candidates also yielded some interesting findings: \n",
    "    - The number of 5 candidates is too low, i.e. it shows a significant deterioration of results relative to the version with more candidates.  \n",
    "    - The best results can be seen for the number of candidates between 10 and 20. Increasing this number to 50 can result in worse results (TSPD, TSPC, min in TSPB). \n",
    "- The steepest local search algorithm without candidates seems to achieve similar results for its candidate counterparts with *N* larger than 10, although it's worth noting that - counterintuitively - the algorithm with candidates (ergo - with restricted neighborhood) can achieve better results in terms of mean cost:\n",
    "    - LSC50 for TSPA (77845 < 77856)\n",
    "    - LSC50 for TSPB (71259 < 71288)\n",
    "    - LSC15 for TSPC (51370 < 51427)\n",
